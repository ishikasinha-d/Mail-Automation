## Software Design

**1.** Doesn’t support windows as it uses ‘simple-term-menu’, a python package which creates simple interactive menus on the command line.
**2.** Modules:
**a.** manage_message.py

- to create drafts (with and without attachments)
- to send messages (with and without attachments)
  **b.** manage_downloads.py
- to download attachment
- to download the whole mail along with attachments if any
  **c.** manage_labels.py
- to create a label
- to add email to label
  **d.** logger.py -> to log data into log file
  **e.** utils.py -> utility functions for interactive menu displayed using ‘TerminalMenu’ from simple_term_menu package
  **f.** mail_manager.py -> to display menu, take user choice as input and perform the desired operation

## How to use?

**1.** Run python3 main.py
You’ll be redirected to OAuth Consent Screen

**Note->**
**At present, this software isn’t in production so you can login only if your mail has been registered as a tester by the developer**

<h3 align="center">
  <b>OR<b> 
</h3>

**You can generate you own API credentials.**
**Steps->**

- Create a project in the <a href='https://console.cloud.google.com/project?authuser=0'>Google Developers Consolet</a> (Google Cloud Platform)
- Enable Gmail API
- <a href='https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent'>Configure OAuth Consent Screen</a> and add your email as tester.
- Create <a href='https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id'>OAuth Client ID Credentials</a> and download the credentials file in the application’s folder named as ‘credentials.json’.

**2.** Once you have authorized the software, the following will be displayed on the browser.

`The authentication flow has completed. You may close this window.`

**This process of authentication is required only the first time.**

**<ins>Reason:</ins>** When the authentication flow is completed, a file ‘token.json’ will be saved in your system which will be used for authentication the next time you login.
